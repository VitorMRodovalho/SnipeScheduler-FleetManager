# SnipeScheduler FleetManager

A comprehensive fleet vehicle management system built on top of [Snipe-IT](https://snipeitapp.com/), designed for enterprise fleet operations with reservation scheduling, maintenance tracking, and compliance management.

## Why This Project?

This project was born from a real need in **large-scale infrastructure programs**. The challenge was managing diverse assets on a single platform: not just IT equipment, but **fleet vehicles** used by construction management, PMO staff, and field personnel across multiple project areas.

### The Problem
- Snipe-IT excels at IT asset management but lacks reservation/scheduling capabilities
- Fleet vehicles require advance booking, check-out/check-in workflows, and inspection tracking
- Paper-based vehicle check-out processes were inefficient and lacked governance
- No single platform to manage both IT assets and fleet vehicles

### The Solution
**SnipeScheduler FleetManager** extends Snipe-IT with a user-friendly frontend specifically designed for fleet operations:
- Uses Snipe-IT's API as the **single source of truth** for all asset data
- Adds reservation scheduling with approval workflows
- Implements digital vehicle inspection checklists
- Provides maintenance tracking integrated with Snipe-IT custom fields
- Maintains full audit trail and compliance reporting

## Features

### For Drivers
- 📅 **Book Vehicles** - Reserve vehicles in advance with pickup/return times
- 📱 **Mobile-Friendly** - Responsive design with QR code scanning
- ✅ **Digital Inspections** - Complete checkout/checkin forms on any device
- 📧 **Email Notifications** - Confirmation, reminders, and approvals

### For Fleet Staff
- 👥 **Approval Workflow** - Review and approve/reject reservations
- 🚗 **Vehicle Management** - Track all fleet vehicles and their status
- 🔧 **Maintenance Tracking** - Flag issues, track maintenance history
- 📊 **Reports** - Utilization, compliance, and usage reports

### For Administrators
- ⚙️ **Full Configuration** - LDAP/OAuth authentication, SMTP, custom fields
- 🔔 **Notification Controls** - Configure who receives which emails
- 📢 **Announcements** - Display system-wide notices to users
- 🔒 **Security Dashboard** - Monitor backup status and security checks
- 📋 **Reservation Controls** - Set booking rules (min notice, max duration, blackouts)

### Asset Creation Template

When creating a new fleet vehicle in Snipe-IT:

1. **Asset Tag**: Use consistent format (e.g., `VEH-001`)
2. **Model**: Select appropriate vehicle model
3. **Status**: Set to `VEH-Available`
4. **Category**: Select `Vehicles`
5. **Location**: Set default/home location
6. **Custom Fields**: Fill in VIN, mileage, license plate
7. **Requestable**: Enable for booking availability

## API Integration

SnipeScheduler uses the Snipe-IT API exclusively - no direct database access to Snipe-IT.

Key API operations:
- `GET /hardware` - List available vehicles
- `PATCH /hardware/{id}` - Update status, location, custom fields
- `GET /users` - Validate users and group membership
- `GET /statuslabels` - Get status options
- `GET /locations` - Get pickup/destination options

## Database Schema

See [docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md](docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md) for complete schema documentation.

SnipeScheduler maintains its own database for:
- Reservations and approval history
- Inspection responses
- Email queue and notifications
- Announcements and blackout slots

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for security documentation.

Key security features:
- CSRF protection on all forms
- XSS prevention with output encoding
- SQL injection prevention with PDO
- Security headers (X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc.)
- Config file permissions (640)
- Automated daily backups
